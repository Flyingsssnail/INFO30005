        <p> It's easy to check if an electrical item,
            toy or game is recyclable if it reached the end of its working life.
            Simply ask the following questions and if the answer is yes, to any of these, it is recyclable:
            Does it have a plug?
            Does it use batteries?
            Does it need charging?
            Does it have a picture of a crossed out wheelie bin on it?</p>
